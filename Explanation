The method used in the algorithm is Value Iteration.
The belief state is created (only reachable states), with
each state given initially a utility of zero,
except terminal states (those who reached the deadline only)
which are given the number of people saved by the agent as utility.
The Value Iteration algorithm is run until there are no more
efficient Bellman updates - updates where a utility was changed
for some belief state.
