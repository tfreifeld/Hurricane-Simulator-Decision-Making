# Hurricane-Simulator-Decision-Making
An assigmnet I made for an intro course on Artificial Intelligence.
The program constructs a belief space for an hurricane evacuation scenario,
and compute the optimal policy for the agent.
The method used for computing the policy is Value Iteration.
The program creates two files "optimalPath.txt" and "beliefSpace.txt":
The first gives a detailed description of the states relevant to the
optimal policy, and the second lists every state generated when
developing the belief space.
